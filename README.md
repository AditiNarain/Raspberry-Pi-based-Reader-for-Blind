# Raspberry-Pi-based-Reader-for-Blind
Our device is reading the text loud in form of audio as we know it's quite difficult for visually impaired people to read a book or newspaper nor any written document. Everytime they don't get braille to read everthing they want and it is costly also.
So this device will give them opportuinity to read any thing at anytime they want.
The device will capture image and all the text written there will be read by the speaker.
We have used OCR technology for converting the jpg image to text image and text image to audio by using TTS technology.
